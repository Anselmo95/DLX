\section{Synthesis}
After the design phase, we used the Synopsis DC Compiler tool to produce a synthesized version of our \dlx processor. We decided to run the script, provided in appendix \ref{syn_scr} for the synthesis several times, and we obtained quite different results.
At first, we have compiled all the needed components respecting the existing hierarchies. It is worth nothing that we have provided for every component also the configuration, in order to have the possibility of trying different implementations for future improvement. At first the script for the synthesis just launches a medium effort compilation, so that we can get an overall idea of the slack that we have and the maximum clock frequency that we can reach. 
Then, reports for area, power and timing are generated.

After this step, in the first versions of the script, we were just launching again another compilation with an high effort. After many trials and researches, we found out that we can ask the tool to start from the previously obtained results and try to do a new mapping, targeting better results. The command we have used is:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=B]
	compile -map_effort high -incremental_mapping
\end{lstlisting}

We also noticed that, while trying to decrease the \textit{MAX\_DELAY}, the results obtained change in a relevant way ($65 \space ns$ of difference). In general, the second compilation is capable of sensibly improving the results obtained before, in almost all ways (area, power, timing). In table \ref{tab_rep} are shown the results related to the two stage of the compilation we finally obtained.

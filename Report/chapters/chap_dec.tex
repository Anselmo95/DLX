\section{Decode Stage}

\subsection{Introduction}
The decode stage is the second one. Here the instructions stored in the \textit{IRAM} that have been previously read are decomposed in order to correctly identify all the information regarding the operation that will be performed. In this way, we can read the correct source, target and destination address, as well as the immediate values. Moreover, also the \textsf{OPCODE}, which represents the particular instruction to be executed, is read.

The most relevant signals involved in this stage are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{FLUSH} is a control signal, which is necessary to clean the pipe
	\item \textit{DATAIN} stores the value to be written on the \rf when the write back happens
	\item \textit{IMM1, IMM2} stores the immediate values coming from the instruction, which will be then extended on 32 bits by an appropriate component
	\item \textit{}
	\item \textit{JMP} is high when a jump instruction is fetched
	\item \textit{RI} is a signal which allows us to distinguish between \textit{R-type} and \textit{I-type} instructions, with the goal of correctly identifying the target register
	\item \textit{US} is the signal giving information about the encoded representation, either signed or unsigned
	\item \textit{WR, RD1, RD2} are the enable for the ports of our \rf
	\item \textit{ADD\_WR, ADD\_RD1, ADD\_RD2} are the addresses for the write, read 1 and read 2 ports of the \rf
	\item \textit{DEST\_IN} is the address of the destination address
	\item \textit{US\_TO\_EX} is used to transfer the information regarding unsigned/signed representation to the following stages of the pipe
	\item \textit{A,B,C,D} are the outputs, storing the values coming from the \textsf{RF} and the two immediate values
	\item \textit{RT, RS} are the addresses of the target and source address respectively, which are needed to implement the data forwarding
	\item \textit{DEST\_OUT} is the address for the final commit during the write back stage
\end{itemize}

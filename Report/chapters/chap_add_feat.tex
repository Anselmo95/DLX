\section{Dynamic branch prediction}
In order not to waste too much clock cycles waiting for the correct value of the \textit{PC} register, we have designed a unit that provides a dynamic prediction regarding a branch instruction. In particular, it is possible, with a defined value of the \textit{PC} corresponding to a branch, to get whether is a better speculation to take or not to take the branch, while waiting for the correct \textit{PC}, which comes after the execution stage. 
There are
